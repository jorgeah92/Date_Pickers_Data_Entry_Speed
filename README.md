# Date_Pickers_Data_Entry_Speed
Experiment of Effect of Date Pickers on Data Entry Speed

An experiment that used Mechanical Turk participants to compare the speed of data entry for dates using two formats, a calendar interface and manual entry. Designed and executed an online experiment disguised as a car rental form that participants needed to fill out. Tested speed of date entry using the two formats with two different date lengths, as in a date close to the current date and another further away. Participants where assigned the entry format randomly upon entering the site and were locked in to that entry format regardless of refreshing the site. After collecting data from 1534 participants, we performed statistical checks and analysis. This includes covariant balance checks and addressing imbalances, and building a regression model. Results showed that the calendar interface as quicker for entry especially for closer dates to the current date.
